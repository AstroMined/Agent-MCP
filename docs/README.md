# Agent-MCP Documentation

## What is Agent-MCP?

A protocol for coordinating multiple AI agents to work on software projects without stepping on each other. Think of it as git for AI collaboration - agents can work on different parts of your codebase simultaneously without conflicts.

## Quick Links

**Need to get started?** → [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)  
**Want to understand MCDs?** → [MCD Guide](./mcd-guide.md)  
**Looking for the theory?** → Start with [Chapter 1](./chapter-1-cognitive-empathy.md)

## Core Documentation

### Theory (Why it works)
1. [Cognitive Empathy](./chapter-1-cognitive-empathy.md) - Understanding how AI thinks differently
2. [Context as Foundation](./chapter-2-context-foundation.md) - Why MCDs matter
3. [Tools as Extensions](./chapter-3-tools-extensions.md) - How AI interacts with your environment
4. [Intelligent Judgment](./chapter-4-intelligent-judgment.md) - Programming as theory building

### Practice (How to use it)
- [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) - Installation to first project
- [MCD Guide](./mcd-guide.md) - Creating effective project blueprints
- [API Reference](./api-reference.md) - Technical details

## The Basics

**MCD (Main Context Document)**: A detailed blueprint of your project that tells AI agents exactly what to build. No ambiguity, no hallucinations.

**Admin Agent**: Coordinates the work, assigns tasks, manages context.

**Worker Agents**: Specialized agents that implement specific features.

**The workflow**: Write MCD → Admin loads it → Creates workers → They build your project.
