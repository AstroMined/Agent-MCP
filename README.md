# Agent MCP üöÄ

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/rinadelph/Agent-MCP)

![Agent Workflow](assets/images/agent-workflow_resized.png)

A framework for creating multi-agent systems using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for coordinated, efficient AI collaboration.

## üéØ Quick Install

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rinadelph/Agent-MCP.git
cd Agent-MCP

# Upgrade pip and setuptools (if needed)
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools>=64

# Install with pip (creates the agent-mcp command)
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
agent-mcp --version
```

That's it! You can now use `agent-mcp` from anywhere.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

> **Note**: I recommend using [MultipleCursor](https://github.com/rinadelph/MultipleCursor) to launch different chat windows on the same codebase as shown in the screenshot above.

### 1. Set Up Environment
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
# Run from any directory after installation
agent-mcp server --project-dir /path/to/your/project

# Or if running from the Agent-MCP directory:
agent-mcp server --project-dir .
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your dashboard!

### 3. Create Main Context Document (MCD)
- Create a detailed `MCD.md` file in your project with architecture, API routes, data models, etc.
- This can be a single file or multiple files (for complex projects)
- See the [MCD-EXAMPLE](./MCD-EXAMPLE) folder for templates

### 4. Find Your Admin Token
The admin token is stored in your project's database:
1. Install a SQLite viewer extension in your code editor
2. Open `.agent/mcp_state.db` in your project directory
3. Check the `project_context` table for the admin token

### 5. Launch Admin Agent
1. Open your AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) in your project folder
2. Ask the AI to "Initialize as an admin agent with this token: [your-token]"
3. Tell the admin agent to add your MCD to the project context:
   ```
   Please add the MCD.md file to the project context. Don't summarize it.
   ```

### 6. Create and Manage Worker Agents
1. Ask your admin agent to create a worker agent:
   ```
   Create a worker agent with ID "frontend-worker" to implement the login page.
   ```
2. Open a new window/session in your AI assistant (same codebase)
3. Initialize the worker with this exact prompt:
   ```
   You are [worker-id] agent, your Admin Token: "[admin-token]"

   Look at your tasks and ask the project RAG agent at least 5-7 questions to understand what you need to do. I want you to critically think when asking a question, then criticize yourself before asking that question. How you criticize yourself is by proposing an idea, criticizing it, and based on that criticism you pull through with that idea.

   AUTO --worker --memory
   ```
4. The worker will automatically find its assigned tasks and start working

```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project:
```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional
AGENT_MCP_MIGRATION_AUTO_MIGRATE=true
AGENT_MCP_MIGRATION_INTERACTIVE=true
USE_ADVANCED_EMBEDDINGS=true
MCP_RAG_INDEX_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300
```

### Migration Settings
Control database migrations:

## üìö Project Planning with MCD

> **Watch the video tutorial:** [How to add MCD context to Agent MCP](https://www.loom.com/share/16407661b19b477185fe9570c3a6aa3b)

Before starting development, create a **Main Context Document (MCD)** - the single source of truth for your application. This document provides:

- System architecture and component relationships
- UI/UX design for all screens and components
- API routes and endpoints
- Data structures and models
- Implementation units and tasks
- Dependencies and technology stack

**The MCD is critical because:**
1. It enables agents to understand the overall system before working on individual components
2. It allows linear, coordinated building (like constructing a house from blueprints)
3. It reduces token usage by providing structured, relevant context
4. It prevents conflicting implementations between agents

See the `MCD.md` file in this repository for structure and detail level required.

### Database issues
- Check version: `agent-mcp migrate --check`
- Force migration: `agent-mcp migrate --force`
- Restore from backup in `.agent/` directory
